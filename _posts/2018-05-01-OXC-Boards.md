# OXControllr v2 & OXControllr S

A PCB with a USB port and button that plugs into the expansion port on a controller. The USB port can be used with a flash drive as a memory card, and with the appropriate Xbox mod the button can be used to control power on the Xbox itself. The S version is much shorter to provide a more stealth look, but it's much harder to remove from the controller.
