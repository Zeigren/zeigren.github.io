Comes installed with:
* TSOP48 ZIF Socket for NANDs
* TSOP56 ZIF Socket for NORs
* 2x 0.1uF decoupling capacitors for each socket (4 in total)
* 4.7k Ohm Resistor for WP (NOR Socket)
* Your choice of either pin headers or a screw terminal block for external power

Requires:
* Teensy++ 2.0
* External 3.3V DC Power Supply

The NORwegian Teensy Socket Edition requires desoldering the NOR or NAND from your system and placing it into one of the appropriate sockets. This is great if you have a NAND/NOR that is especially problematic, or if you're tired of dealing with crappy clips.

If you're not comfortable with desoldering TSOP packages check out the the NORwegian Teensy Clip Edition.

The NORwegian Teensy Socket Edition does not come with a Teensy++ 2.0 installed. If you order one this is what it will look like + your choice of either headers or a terminal block.
