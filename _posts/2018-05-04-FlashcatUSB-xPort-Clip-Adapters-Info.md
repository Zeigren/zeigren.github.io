## [FlashcatUSB xPort Clip Adapters Hardware Page]({{ "/FlashcatUSB-xPort-Clip-Adapters/" | relative_url}})

The clip adapters are all designed to work with the FlashcatUSB xPort made by [EmbeddedComputers](http://www.embeddedcomputers.net/products/FlashcatUSB_xPort/), on that webpage is a list of the NAND and NOR flashes it supports.

The names of the adapters use the same naming convention as those of the FlashcatUSB [Parallel Adapters](http://www.embeddedcomputers.net/products/ParallelAdapters/) since they support flashes with the same pinouts, on that webpage you can buy socket versions of all these adapters as well as other socket adapters.

For each clip adapter there is an image of the NAND/NOR pinouts that it supports, so you can figure out which adapter will work with the flash you need to program.

You can download the software for the FlashcatUSB xPort from [here](http://www.embeddedcomputers.net/software/).

[Here](https://youtu.be/0JLvI2vaAI8) is a video I made about these clip adapters as well as a basic tutorial on using them with the FlashcatUSB xPort. I also have some basic guides [here]({{ "/FlashcatUSB-xPort-Clip-Adapters-Guide-Index/" | relative_url}}) as well.

You can find the clips themselves on websites like eBay, AliExpress, and various modchip/modding websites. If you're not sure if a clip you found is the right one feel free to e-mail me.

# TSOP48 NAND UNI (Type B) Adapter
![TSOP48 NAND UNI (Type B)](/assets/img/FlashcatAdapters/48_NANDUNI_B.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
![NAND](/assets/img/FlashcatAdapters/NAND.png){:class="img-responsive"}

An adapter for the FlashcatUSB xPort to read/write TSOP48 NAND flash memory using the TSOP48 UNI Clip.

It uses buffers in order to supply a "signal boost" on the same signals that I "boosted" on my other boards.

Using a jumper the power source can be switched between using power from the FlashcatUSB xPort to using power from an external power source. At the end of the board you can put pins which you can use to supply power from an external power source, there is also a footprint for a capacitor if you need it for your setup. The capacitor footprint is for a capacitor with 2mm lead spacing, something like [this](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/wurth-electronics-inc/860010372006/732-8598-1-ND/5728555) should work.

Works with PS3 NANDs.

An adapter for the FlashcatUSB xPort to read/write TSOP48 NOR flash memory using the TSOP48 UNI Clip. It has a row of pin headers that you can use to change the pinout from supporting 28 Series NORs to 29 Series.

For 28 Series the pins will look like this:

29           28

{XX-}{XX-}{XX-}

For 29 Series the pins will look like this:

29           28

{-XX}{-XX}{-XX}

# Power Supply Adapter
![Power Supply Adapter](/assets/img/FlashcatAdapters/FCXA_PSU.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

A power supply adapter that can sit on top of the clip adapters.

You can power it using either a USB phone charger or some other 5v power source.

It can supply 2A at 3.3V or 0.75-3V. You can use a jumper to switch between either a fixed 3.3v output or a variable output from 0.75-3V which you adjust with a trimmer potentiometer. Using the switch you can bypass the voltage regulator and pass thru the 5V from either the USB port or your 5v power source.

The power supply has output pin headers so it can be used on its own, in case you want to use it with other projects.

There is a footprint for an optional input capacitor that you can install if it is needed for your particular setup, it uses a capacitor with 3.5mm lead spacing and an 8mm diameter like [this one](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/nichicon/RR71C101MDN1/493-3716-ND/2207252).

Make sure to change the voltage before connecting anything to it to prevent damaging whatever you connect to it. When using it with the FlashcatUSB xPort use only the same voltage as it, so either 3.3v or 5v.
