## You can find more info about the Hedgehog1286 [here]({{ "/Hedgehog1286-Info/" | relative_url}}).

The Hedgehog1286 is essentially a Teensy++ 2.0 clone with some alterations.

It features an Atmel (Microchip) at90USB1286 16MHz 8-Bit AVR microcontroller with 128KB of flash memory, 8KB of SRAM, and 4KB of EEPROM.

It supports USB full-speed and is programmable over USB using its DFU bootloader.

It can operate on either 5v or 3.3v via an onboard switch. By using a USB phone charger it can supply somewhere around 2 amps at 3.3v.

It has 46 I/O pins, 7 ground pins, and 7 power pins all broken out to pin header receptacles. Which can accept standard 2.54mm(0.100") pitch pin headers from either the top or bottom of the board.

There are at this time 5 optional [expansion]({{ "/Hedgehog1286-Expansions/" | relative_url}}) boards that plug directly into it. Currently they are all for reading/writing NOR/NANDs.

The Hedgehog1286 with expansions are a replacement for the NORwegian Teensy boards.
