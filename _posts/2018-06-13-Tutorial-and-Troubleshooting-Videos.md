I have two new videos up on my YouTube channel. One is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/mcuzO3ZSaBg) on using a clip adapter in circuit, the other goes over some [troubleshooting](https://youtu.be/43VDcZQesHo) tips. I also keep adding stuff to my [guides]({{ "/FlashcatUSB-xPort-Clip-Adapters-Guide-Index/" | relative_url}}) as I think of them.
