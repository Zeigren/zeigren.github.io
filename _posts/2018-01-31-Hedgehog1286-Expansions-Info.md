# Hedgehog1286 E3 NOR Expansion

The Hedgehog1286 E3 NOR Expansion has a connector to accept an E3 NOR clip for reading/writing to TSOP 56 NORs. I would recommend looking at the PS3 Guides for the NORwegian Teensy Clip Edition to get a good idea of using the clips. Also check the [PS3 Downgrading Getting Started guide.]({{ "/PS3-Downgrading-Getting-Started/" | relative_url}}) This doesn't have the full 60 pins that can be used with the Hedgehog1286 so make sure to line it up correctly when connecting them.

# Hedgehog1286 NAND Expansion

The Hedgehog1286 NAND Expansion has a connector for both the E3 Clip and the NAND 48 PIN UNI clip which can be used with the Hedgehog1286 in order to read/write TSOP 48 NANDs. I would recommend looking at the PS3 Guides for the NORwegian Teensy Clip Edition to get a good idea of using the clips. Also check the [PS3 Downgrading Getting Started guide.]({{ "/PS3-Downgrading-Getting-Started/" | relative_url}}) This doesn't have the full 60 pins that can be used with the Hedgehog1286 so make sure to line it up correctly when connecting them.

# Hedgehog1286 TSOP NAND Expansion

The Hedgehog1286 TSOP NAND Expansion allows either the 32 pin 360 clip or a TSOP 48 socket to be used with the Hedgehog1286 in order to read/write TSOP 48 NANDs. The TSOP 48 socket must be purchased separately from somewhere like eBay or AliExpress. I would recommend looking at the PS3 Guides for the NORwegian Teensy Clip Edition to get a good idea of using the clips, and for the NORwegian Teensy Socket Edition for the sockets. Also check the [PS3 Downgrading Getting Started guide.]({{ "/PS3-Downgrading-Getting-Started/" | relative_url}}) This doesn't have the full 60 pins that can be used with the Hedgehog1286 so make sure to line it up correctly when connecting them.
