Like the title says the [TSOP48 NAND 360 (Type B) Adapters]({{ "/FlashcatUSB-xPort-Clip-Adapters/" | relative_url}}) are back in stock.

Besides the [Riot room](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#FCXAdapters:matrix.org) you can also visit the [BlackCatUSB](https://www.blackcatusb.net/index.php) forum if you have any questions about the FlashCatUSB or my adapters. There's already a [thread](https://www.blackcatusb.net/index.php?threads/tsop56-48-nor-nand-clip-adapters-for-the-flashcatusb-xport.493/#post-4009) about the adapters so you can ask questions about them there.
