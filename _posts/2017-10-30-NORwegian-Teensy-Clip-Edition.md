The NORwegian Teensy Clip Edition is an easy way to read/write to TSOP56 NORs and TSOP48 NANDs using all the various clips out there. You don't need to solder wires between clip daughter boards and the Teensy++ 2.0, just plug the clip directly into the appropriate connector and you're good to go.

It also has a built in 5v to 3.3v voltage regulator, so all you need is a 5v 2Amp USB phone charger in order to power everything.

### Features
* **READ/WRITE NANDS WITH THE E3 NOR CLIP**
* **Read/write NORs with the E3 NOR clip**
* Read/write NANDs with the 360 clip (32 pin)
* Read/write NANDs with the NAND UNI Clip (48 pin)
* Read/write NANDs with the NOR UNI Clip (56 pin)
* Read/write NORs with the NOR UNI Clip (56 pin)
* Can be powered over microUSB with a 2 amp phone charger, no external power supply needed
* Uses an L-C power filter as well as dedicated decoupling capacitors for each clip to provide clean and stable power
* Utilizes the Teensy++ 2.0 in conjunction with judges NORway and NANDway Signal Booster Edition software to read/write NORs and NANDs
* Has 3.3v power output headers

### Comes installed with:
* 2x E3 connectors one for NANDs, one for NORs
* 2x 60 pin connectors for NOR and NAND UNI clips
* 32 pin connector for 32 pin 360 clips
* MicroUSB power only connector
* Texas Instruments TPS62086 5v to 3.3v 3amp Step-Down converter with L-C filter
* 8x 0.1uF decoupling capacitors
* 2x 10-bit bus switches for switching the circuit between NORway and NANDway Signal Booster Edition
* 4.7k Ohm Resistor for WP (NOR UNI Clip)
* Your choice of either pin headers or a screw terminal block for power output
* Pin header to connect to Tristate (for NORs)

### Requires:
* Teensy++ 2.0
* Whatever clips you want to use with it
* A computer
* 2 Amp phone charger

If you ordered it without the Teensy++ 2.0 installed it will look like this, except with headers and a switch installed.
