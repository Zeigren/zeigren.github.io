Have any questions or just want to talk about the FlashcatUSB xPort Clip Adapters? Head on over to the [Riot.im](https://riot.im) room at [#FCXAdapters:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#FCXAdapters:matrix.org). You can also visit the [BlackCatUSB](https://www.blackcatusb.net/index.php) forum where there's already a [thread](https://www.blackcatusb.net/index.php?threads/tsop56-48-nor-nand-clip-adapters-for-the-flashcatusb-xport.493/) for the adapters. Or you can of course e-mail me or leave a comment on the forum thread of your choice.
