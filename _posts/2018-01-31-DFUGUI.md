# DFUGUI
## A graphical user interface for dfu-programmer

The [DFUGUI](https://github.com/Zeigren/DFUGUI) GitHub page.

You can find more info about dfu-programmer on their [github](https://github.com/dfu-programmer/dfu-programmer) and their [website](https://dfu-programmer.github.io/)


In a nutshell DFUGUI uses dfu-programmer in order to do firmware upgrades for USB enabled Atmel microcontrollers that have a compatible bootloader.

Copied from the dfu-programmer github page here is a list of chips that currently work with it

DFUGUI only works on Windows and is very much a work in progress.
If you need it you can download the USB drivers [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dfu-programmer/files/dfu-programmer/0.7.2/)

## Using DFUGUI
You only need the DFUGUI.exe that's in the Release folder. Run that and you'll have some tabs to select the microcontroller based on its family.

Once the microcontroller you need is highlighted pick the command tab that you want, it's appropriate options, and then hit the appropriate button.

When you're all done you can hit the launch button to jump the microcontroller to your newly programmed firmware.

Any discussion about DFUGUI can be made at the [Riot.im](https://riot.im) Community [here](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+dfugui:matrix.org).
