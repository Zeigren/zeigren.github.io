In the above links you can find more info about the clip adapters as well as purchase them.

After I had already designed and ordered my Hedgehog1286 boards someone pointed me to [EmbeddedComputers](http://www.embeddedcomputers.net/) and specifically their [FlashcatUSB xPort](http://www.embeddedcomputers.net/products/FlashcatUSB_xPort/) and asked if I could make some clip adapters that would work with it. 

The FlashcatUSB xPort is a much better system then my Hedgehog1286 or the Teensy++ 2.0 for reading/writing different models of NAND/NOR flashes. It supports hundreds of different flashes and can read/write to them almost 3x faster, along with a lot of other useful features such as support for different languages. So I decided to drop my Hedgehog1286 boards and just make these clip adapters for the FlashcatUSB xPort.

I'm no longer making any kind of socket adapter since you can buy [FlashcatUSB Parallel Adapters](http://www.embeddedcomputers.net/products/ParallelAdapters/) on the EmbeddedComputers website.

These clip adapters of course do work with PS3s for those who are wondering. 

I have also made a short [video](https://youtu.be/0JLvI2vaAI8) about the clip adapters and using them that you can check out.

I'll also have some guides up [here]({{ "/FlashcatUSB-xPort-Clip-Adapters-Guide-Index/" | relative_url}}) as well.
