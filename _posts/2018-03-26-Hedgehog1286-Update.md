I've been incredibly busy for the past month unfortunately and haven't had time to do anymore testing. I should be able to start testing again in a week or so, I imagine I'll have all the testing done in about 2ish weeks. I will of course make a post when I have all of that sorted out.

Thanks for your patience!
